# PGIS_ESR-512
Slides from the course ESR 512 "GIS in Geostatistics" held by Thusitha Wagalawatta & Daniel Knitter, winter term 2015 at the [Postgraduate Institute of Science](http://www.pgis.lk/) (PGIS), University Peradeniya, Kandy, Sri Lanka

What you will find here (all things are conducted using data from/about Sri Lanka):

- [A short intro to R](html/Intro_R.html)
- [Analyses of climate data from FAO](html/Climate_Data.html)
- [Analyses of Census data](html/Census_Data.html)
- [Shortest path analyses](html/Distance_analyses.html)
- [Small things about interpolation](html/Interpolation.html)
- [Small things about spatial autocorrelation](html/Spatial_Autocorrelation.html)
- [Some things concerning the analyses of terrain](html/Terrain_analyses.html)
- [Some examples of Point Pattern Analyses](html/Point_pattern.html)
- [Viewshed analyses](html/Viewshed_Analysis.html)

Without the lectures some of the material might not be self-explanatory. Nevertheless, perhaps you can still make use of some of the code.

If you want to learn a little more about spatial analyses, with a special focus on archaeology have a look at the book "Modelling Human Behaviour in Landscapes" by Oliver Nakoinz and Daniel Knitter
